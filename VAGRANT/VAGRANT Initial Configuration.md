## VAGRANT INITIAL CONFIGURATION on Windows

### Setup Project
The first step in configuring any Vagrant project is to create a [Vagrantfile](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/).
The purpose of the Vagrantfile is twofold:
1. Mark the root directory of your project;
2. Describe the kind of machine and resources you need to run your project, as well as what software to install and how you want to access it.

Go to the any empty pre-existing dir or go the the just created one:
```
mkdir C:\Users\sergii.burtovyi\vagrant_root
cd C:\Users\sergii.burtovyi\vagrant_root
```
